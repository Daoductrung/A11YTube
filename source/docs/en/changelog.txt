Version 0.3.0
New Features:
- Recommended Videos List: Added a "Recommended Videos" button in the Media Player. You can now manually browse and select from a list of 19 related videos instead of relying solely on the Auto-Next algorithm. (Note: This feature is optimized for music content).
Improvements & Accessibility:
- Seek Announcements: The software now verbally announces the current timestamp whenever you seek through a video.
- Smart Settings: The "MP3 Conversion Quality" dropdown in Settings is now hidden unless "Audio (mp3)" is selected, reducing interface clutter and confusion.
- Playback Status: Improved the clarity of status announcements for the Play/Pause button.
- Seeking Logic: Adjusted the seeking behavior. The player no longer goes silent if you seek past the end of a video; it will instead loop back to the beginning.
Bug Fixes:
- Tab Positioning: Fixed an issue where screen readers would report incorrect position information (e.g., "1 of X") for tabs on the main screen.
- Tab Navigation: `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` now correctly navigate through the main navigation tabs.
- Auto-Next Logic: Fixed a bug where the player would still skip to the next track even if "Auto Next" was disabled, specifically when the "Skip Silence" feature was active.
Version 0.2.9.4
New Features:
- Voice Search: Added a dedicated "Voice Search" button in the search interface. To use it, Tab to the button, Press and Hold Space to speak your query, then release the key to search.
- New Player Shortcut: Added Ctrl + K to copy the link of the currently playing video.
Bug Fixes:
- Skip Silence: Fixed a bug where a video would play twice due to a conflict with the skip silence logic.
- Collection History: Fixed a logic gap where playing videos from a Collection would not correctly save to Watch History if the 'Continue' loop was enabled.
Improvements:
- Performance: Fixed potential freezing issues by optimizing background tasks.
- Localization: Converted several hardcoded text strings into translatable resources, improving language support.
Version 0.2.9.3
Critical Bug Fixes:
- Download Logic: Fixed a critical issue where the "Download" button would incorrectly download the previous search result instead of the currently playing Recommended video. The downloader now correctly targets the active media.
New Features:
- Play Playlist via Link: You can now play an entire playlist directly by pasting its URL (similar to how single video links are handled).
Major Changes: Keyboard Shortcuts Overhaul
The keyboard shortcut scheme has been significantly reorganized to be more logical and intuitive. Please check the new User Guide for the full list.
New assignments include:
- Ctrl + F: Toggle Favorite (Add/Remove the selected video to/from Favorites).
- Ctrl + L: Add to Collection (Open the collection manager for the selected video).
Documentation:
- User Guide Update: The A11YTube User Guide has been completely rewritten to reflect the new shortcut scheme and features. You can access it via the Help tab or by pressing F1.
Version 0.2.9.2
New Features:
- Seamless Track Transition: The media player now supports seamless transitions. The current track continues playing while the next track loads in the background, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted listening experience without gaps or sudden silence.
Improvements & Stability:
- Navigation Spam Protection: Implemented logic to prevent rapid-fire clicking of "Next" or "Previous" buttons.
  + If a track is already loading, repeated commands are ignored.
  + The system verbally notifies "Please wait, track is loading..." to prevent application freezing.
- Stability Fixes:
  + Fixed potential race conditions during auto-next sequences.
  + Fixed various minor bugs.
Maintenance:
- Code Cleanup: Removed redundant code and optimized source code structure.
Version 0.2.9.1
Critical Bug Fixes:
- Skip Silence: Fixed a critical issue where the "Skip Silence" feature only worked for the first track in a session. The system now correctly calculates and applies the start time (skipping silence) for all subsequent tracks, including Auto-Next and Recommended videos.
Media Player Improvements:
- Time Slider Logic: The time slider now automatically resets to 0 when the video is loading or fully stopped. This prevents "fake" time displays and potential player errors.
- Volume Control: Improved volume logic allowing users to adjust the volume (0-100) even when playback is stopped or loading. The setting is saved and applied immediately as soon as the video starts playing.
Accessibility Updates:
- Button Announcements: Refined screen reader feedback for control buttons (Play, Next, Prev, etc.). Pressing Space or Enter now executes the command immediately without the redundant "pressed" announcement, resulting in a cleaner audio experience.
Version 0.2.9
Feature Completion:
- Startup Optimization: The experimental optimizations for application startup speed have been finalized and are now marked as completed.
New Features:
- Recommended Videos (Experimental): Changed the behavior of the "Auto Next" feature. When playing a video from Search Results or Watch History, the application will now queue a related/recommended video as the next track, instead of simply playing the next item in the list.
Improvements:
- Auto-Player: Improved the stability and logic of the automatic playback system.
Version 0.2.8
Improvements:
- Skip Silence: Improved the algorithm for the Skip Silence feature to detect and skip silent parts more accurately.

Version 0.2.7
Feature Completion:
- Multi-language Audio: This feature is now fully stable and marked as completed.
- Lazy Loading: The lazy loading mechanism has been finalized and marked as completed.
New Features:
- Skip Silence (Experimental): Added a new feature for playlist playback. When enabled, the software automatically skips silent parts within videos or music tracks during auto-transitions, creating a seamless continuous listening experience.
- NVDA Notifications: Added "Speak notifications when window is inactive" in Settings (Default: Off). Prevents A11YTube from announcing notifications when you are focused on other windows, unless enabled.
Improvements & Performance:
- Track Transition Speed: Improved the speed of changing tracks when listening in both sequential and shuffle modes.
- Collection Info: Collections now display the total number of videos they contain.
- Playlist Error Handling: If a video fails to load in a playlist, the app now automatically skips to the next track after 1 second instead of showing a blocking dialog.
- Smart Shuffle: Enhanced shuffle algorithm. When the playlist loops and reshuffles, it ensures the first song of the new sequence is different from the last song played.
Bug Fixes:
- Audio Track Switching: The player now correctly remembers and resumes from the current position when switching audio languages, even if "Continue watching" is disabled.

- Channel Actions: Added "Go to Channel" and "Download Channel" options to the video Context Menu.

Bug Fixes:
- Full Screen Shortcuts: Fixed an issue where keyboard shortcuts would stop working when entering Full Screen mode.
- Stability: Fixed a race condition in the "Add to Favorites" checkbox logic that could cause instability in the browser/player interface.

- Startup Enhancements:

Improvements:
- Media Player Optimization: Rewrote the player logic to initialize a fresh, independent VLC instance for every video. This improves memory management and prevents state conflicts.

- System Integration: Changed "Open Downloads Folder" to use the native `os.startfile` command, making it more reliable on customized Windows versions compared to the old `explorer.exe` method.
- Cookie Logic: Improved authentication logic. Importing `cookies.txt` now correctly allows viewing of both age-restricted/Verify it's not a bot content AND regular public videos without issues.
Bug Fixes:

- Swap Play Actions: Added a new configuration in Settings to swap the behavior of Enter and Ctrl+Enter in search results:

- Changelog Viewer: Users can now view the Changelog directly within the Help tab.
Improvements:

- Playlist Downloading Logic: The download process is now more resilient. If a specific video in a playlist fails to download, the application will skip it and continue downloading the remaining items. A notification will appear upon completion detailing the number of successful and failed items.
